# My Blog
This project is **my personal blog**. Doing it i learned about **heroku** applications and how deploy my app to online server, **mongoDB** clusters and how connect my API to online database, also learned about submodules on **git** repositories and how create a performatic and beautiful **React** web application using **styled components** and very more libraries, for exemple: **axios**, date-fns, etc.
